# Final project: Life Rhythm 生之律

## Description
How do humans perceive plants?
At times, we project ourselves into the. The broken branches of trees evoke thoughts of human limbs, yet for humans, body losses is irreversible. But for a tree, losing a branch is quite normal. The energy from the lost limb is redirected to other branches, and only when the roots underground are harmed does the tree actually lose its energy.
That's the life rhythm of trees. As humans, there is no need to overly imbue this with emotion and personal experiences. Just pause and feel!
