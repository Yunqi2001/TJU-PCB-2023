# üîçExploration

## ‚úèÔ∏èDescription
We explored the eco-system [in our campus](#findings-at-tongji-campus) and [Gongqing forest park](#findings-at-gongqing-forest-park) to get some inspiration of the final project.

click [here](#1-the-most-important-finding-which-inspired-my-final-project)( to the finding that finally became my project

## üí°Tips
- use the sense you already have and you wish you have
- think the element in the whole eco-system, think about what makes the element be there, think about the relationship, the system of input and output

- **my eyes:**

- **my arms:** It was a rainy day, the wind brought moisture
- **my feet:**  I felt the slight difference stepping on different surface through my shoes, I rarely pay attention to these different touches in my daily life, most of the time I choose to walk on the concrete road. I think stepping on feet is an important way for human to make connection with the nature, there is a kind of meditate is to walk barefoot, but shoes always separate us from nature.

## Findings at Gongqing Forest Park
üßê We did our second nature exploration at Gongqing Forest Park, where is a less "urban" place compared with our campus. 
This time I got the idea for my final project!
