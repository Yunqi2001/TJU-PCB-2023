- **my arms:** It was a rainy day, the wind brought moisture
- **my feet:**  I felt the slight difference stepping on different surface through my shoes, I rarely pay attention to these different touches in my daily life, most of the time I choose to walk on the concrete road. I think stepping on feet is an important way for human to make connection with the nature, there is a kind of meditate is to walk barefoot, but shoes always separate us from nature.
