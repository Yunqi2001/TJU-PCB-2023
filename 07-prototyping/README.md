## 💡Tips
- make simple things, don't use complicate materials
- sth to make shapes + sth to cut + sth to join things together
- don't make a sketch first, let the materials to inspire you
- always change the idea, let it evolve while making
- don't use rulers or measuring tools, use the rule of thumb to save time
